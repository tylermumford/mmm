# Contributing

This is a project for other people. I'm very interested in feedback on the idea and design.
Would you convert a Makefile and use this instead? Or use both? Or does this seem like a
bad idea for some reason? Let me know.

This is a personal project. I don't know how I feel about accepting code from other people.
For now, if you want to contribute, please ask first, or keep pull requests small (think
~100 lines of code at a time). ðŸ’š
